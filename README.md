# Form Builder


### Intro
Form Builder is a website that enables registered users to create their own forms and edit the fields in a form. Editing the fields for a form is highly interactive and it includes CRUD operations for both forms and fields. Mobile first is the design philosophy and it's also a single page web application.


### Technologies
* HTML5, CSS3, BootStrap, JavaScript, AngularJS, jQuery, jQuery UI(sortable)
* Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose
* Openshift, git, WebStorm IDE
